# Landing-Page-Project
TOP Landing Page Project at the end of the Flexbox module

re: stylesheet
Lines 1 - 141 contain styling for the buttons, header, and hero element. 
It almost certainly can be cleaned up, but for now this is what it is. (as of 5/22/25)
Lines 143 - 164 contain styling for the quote box and contents within
Lines 143 - 196 contain styling for the call to action section
Lines 198 - 208 contain styling for the footer

re: html 
Lines 30 - 50 have the content for the information section, this may not be the best division of content/grouping of containers. I may have over complicated it.
